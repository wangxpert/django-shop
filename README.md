# Breaking News

Today, as of 2015-12-05, I finally finished three demos which should run out of the box.

Please read the files ``docs/tutorial/intro.rst`` and ``docs/tutorial/quickstart.rst``. Following
the instructions should create a running shop in minutes, prefilled with a dozen of products.
You can even pay by credit card, if you apply for your own testing account at Stripe.

I would be happy to get some feedback.


# django SHOP

This version of django-shop is currently under active development. If you want
to help out, please have a look at our development documentation in the ``DEVELOPMENT.rst`` file.

Django SHOP aims to be the easy, fun and fast shop counterpart to django CMS.

Specifically, we aim at providing a clean, modular and Pythonic/Djangonic implementation of a shop
framework, that a moderately talented Django programmer should be able to pick up and run easily.
