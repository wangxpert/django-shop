======================
Django-shop repository
======================

This repository should host Django-Shop code and documentation.

While it should get started as soon as possible, we should focus on writing a clear statement of what
Django-shop should be before we start commiting actual code.

So for the time being, documentation is the master word!

Use the docs/ directory to go nuts!
