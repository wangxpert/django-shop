======================
Django-shop repository
======================

This repository should host Django-Shop code and documentation.

While it should get started as soon as possible, we should focus on writing a clear statement of what
Django-shop should be before we start commiting actual code.

So for the time being, documentation is the master word!

Use the docs/ directory to go nuts!

How to help:
============

# Development is done on github - please fork!
# Most of the discussion around architecture decisions / tools etc... take place on IRC (Freenode), on #django-shop
