Products
========

Handling a large number of different products can be a headache, since most products have very different properties
from one another (think amazon and the plethora of differnet stuff they sell).

Other Django-based webshops handle the complexity in a clever way: make the core product very extensible with so-called
product attributes. Similar to key-value tags, product attributes allow for very flexible product creation, and a clever
set of model managers hide the complexity of theses added tables quite well.

See snippets/products.py for more info.
